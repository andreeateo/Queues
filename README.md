# Queues

Queues is a software library that provides the following useful generic  data structures:
- a **Deque**(*double-ended queue*) implemented using a Singly Linked List -  supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.
- a **Randomized Queue** implemented using a Resizing Array - the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure.

**Project Structure**
- src: project source code
- lib_deps: library dependencies
- test: **JUnit** tests
- test_cases: test data files
- nbproject: NetBeans project file
- build.xml

**Prerequisites**

NetBeans IDE - for download and install go to https://netbeans.org/

**Set-up**

1. Download the project on your drive.
2. Import the Java Project in NetBeans.

**Testing**

JUnit test files in the test folder.
Permutation.java reads in a sequence of strings from .txt folders and tests weather the RandomizedQueue iterator returns the elements in a random order.
